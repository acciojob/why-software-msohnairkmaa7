	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>The ability to work from home is increasingly important to job candidates. Since almost all of their work is done on a computer, software developers are often able to work remotely from home.However, as long as a software developer is able to communicate with their team, they can often work from other locations like shared workspaces, hotels or coffee shops. This flexibility can make software development a good career option for people who like to travel a lot.</p>
